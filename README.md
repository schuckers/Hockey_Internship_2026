# Spring 2026 Hockey Research Internship

This page is meant to provide information about a research internship for the Spring 2026 semester at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte.  The internship is sponsored by the Los Angeles Kings.  Students selected for this internship will receive course credit and will be mentored by Prof. Michael Schuckers and by members of the distinguished hockey analytics staff of the LA Kings.  This is a tremendous opportunity to work on significant hockey-related questions while receiving advice and guidance from working professionals in sports analytics.  

Students who are selected for this internship based upon their application will be mentored by Dr. Michael Schuckers during the Spring 2026 semester.  These students will be provided with access to the relevant data by the Kings, no later than January 5, 2026. Students will meet weekly with Prof. Schuckers and approximately bi-weekly or as necessary with Kings staff.  Neither the work that is part of this internship, nor the data provided by the Kings will be made public without the written consent of the Kings.  At the end of the internship, students will create a summary of their work that will be presented to the Kings.  Undergraduate students will receive three credit hours of DTSC 3400 course credit for this internship, while graduate students will receive DTSC 6400 credit.  

## Topics for the internship
There are two areas of interest for these internships: 1) prospect evaluation and 2) transactions.  These are described below.  As part of the application students will submit a one-page description of the work they would like to do in one of these two areas.  That description should include the motivation for the analysis as well as the methods to be used.  

### Prospect Evaluation
For projects in this area, student will work with written public scouting reports, such as the EliteProspects Draft Guide, along with some basic biographical and statistical information about draft-eligible prospects. Work in this area should be anchored on predicting who will play in the NHL or where a player will be drafted.  [<https://webpages.charlotte.edu/mschuck1/sports/EliteProspects2025DraftGuide(Excerpt).pdf>].  

### Transactions
For transactions, students will be provided a list of all NHL transactions (trades, contract signings, waiver wire pickups, etc), along with contractual data, and basic biographical and statistical information.  Students will use these data, similar to [<https://www.nhltradetracker.com/home>], and generate new insights. 

## Application

Interested students should submit an application by October 12, 2025 at 11:59pm PT.  As part of the application, students will have to provide some information about themselves (name, email, etc), an unofficial transcript, a description of why they are interested in this internship and a one-page description of the project they would like to undertake.  


Short Zoom interviews (15-20 minutes) may be conducted among a select group of finalists.  A maximum of 5 students will be selected for this internship.   The internship will be open both to graduate and undergraduate students.


## Prizes
The opportunity to work and interact with the high caliber Kings staff is the primary prize for this proposal.  It may be possible that the Kings offer additional swag or tickets.  In exceptional cases, interns may be offered the chance to continue their work with the Kings as part of a summer internship.
